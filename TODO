TODO

-Use the ByteUtil class in the ParseCaptureFile.java to remove any duplicate functions
-add the parameters from the user (filter, follow TCP stream, ...)
-Make a package
-Separate the protocols from the other files (in another folder)
-modify the methods in ByteUtil to operate on the current value at the offset
-get rid of the padding (if any) at any layer that specifies it
-For the protocol class and any class that extends it, introduce a function printing the content of its data with a padding (for a better ~visual experience~), keep the ToString but add another method


MAYBE ?

-Rename LinkLayer to Frame ?
-Add an endianness value in ByteUtil?




DONE
-Add a 'toIPV4Address()' method to the ByteUtil class to return 4 bytes of data arranged to a IPv4 address (string)
-modify the toInt() and toShort() methods of ByteUtil to account for the signed-ness of the
	data types in Java !
-add a toLong() method in ByteUtil
-add a toMacAddress() method to the ByteUtil class to return 6 bytes of data arranger to a MAC addresse string
